 <h1 class="innerpage__subheading">Allrecipes Microinteraction Redesign</h1>
 <main class="innerpage">
  <img src="pictures/hero.png" class="innerpage__heroimage" alt="Admin Prototype">
      
  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Overview</h3>
  <p class="innerpage__text">
    As the UI/UX designer, I used Figma to redesign Perpay's admin across a five week period. </p>

  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Background</h3>
  <p class="innerpage__text">
    Micro-interactions are small, subtle animations that provide the user visual feedback that they have either successfully or unsuccessfully made a change. Micro interactions play a huge role in a user’s experience because they alleviate their cognitive load and add fun personality to the user experience, making the product more memorable and enjoyable to use.</p>
  <p class="innerpage__text">
    Within a ten week period, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to transform Allrecipes’s favorite recipe microinteraction into one that is delightful and easy to use.</p>
    
  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Problem</h3>
  <p class="innerpage__challenge">Allrecipes needs an "Add to Favorites" microinteraction that provides <span class="bold pinkhighlight">clear, intuitive, and meaningful</span> feedback.</p>

  <div class="text__wrapper">
    <div class="picturerow">
        <div class="picturecolumn">
          <p class>  ↆ Allrecipe's current microinteraction</p>
            <img src="pictures/combined.gif" class="aboutpicture">
      </div>
    <div class="picturecolumn">
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold pinkunderline">No hover state on buttons:</span> A hover state for a button is essential because it's a clear indication  that the button is clickable. The buttons have cursor changes, but no other visual feedback.</li>
        <li><span class="bold pinkunderline">Full screen modal:</span> Full screen modals disrupt the user's workflow and force the attention to the modal. They should only be used if you want the user to undertake an action.</li>
        <li><span class="bold pinkunderline">Poor ease of access:</span> After saving a recipe, if the user wants to move said recipe to a collection, they have to go through two extra loading screens: one for the saved items and one for the collections page.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Objectives</h3>


      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold pinkunderline">Include 5 triggers:</span> Design a complex and meaningful microinteraction with at least 5 triggers</li>
        <li><span class="bold pinkunderline">Provide Feedback:</span> Provide immediate and clear feedback to the users  </li>
        <li><span class="bold pinkunderline">Meaningful Animations:</span> Create animations on every trigger- there shouldn't be anything that just appears</li>
      </ul>
    
  
  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Phase 1: Alpha</h3>
  <img src="pictures/alpha big.gif" class="innerpage__image ">
  
  <p class="innerpage__text">This project spanned across a five week period using the agile framework. The team consisted of two Operations members, two engineers, one product manager, and me as the UI/UX designer.</p>
  
  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Phase 2: Beta</h3>
  <img src="pictures/admin/process.png" class="innerpage__image ">
  <p class="innerpage__text">This project spanned across a five week period using the agile framework. The team consisted of two Operations members, two engineers, one product manager, and me as the UI/UX designer.</p>
  
  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Phase 3: Final</h3>
  <img src="pictures/admin/process.png" class="innerpage__image ">
  <p class="innerpage__text">This project spanned across a five week period using the agile framework. The team consisted of two Operations members, two engineers, one product manager, and me as the UI/UX designer.</p>
  
  
  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Solution</h3>
  <p class="innerpage__text">The product manager and I conducted a series of user interviews, testing, and surveys with the Operations members to better understand their main pain points.</p>
  <div class="text__wrapper">

          <p class>  ↆ Existing Admin Design</p>
            <img src="pictures/admin/Old admin 1.png" class="aboutpicture">
      </div>
    <div class="picturecolumn">
      <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Here's what we found out:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold pinkunderline">Excessive page length:</span> Our users' number one pain point was the length of the page. Because their work relies on finding information at a glance, the unintuitive layout of the existing page adds on time to the users' tasks</li>
        <li><span class="bold pinkunderline">Slow page load:</span> Because every customer support data point was loaded on the existing Admin page, the page took up to 2-3 minutes to load. With hundreds of customers to help each day, these minutes add up and make the users' work inefficient.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

   -->


  
  <h3 class="innerpage__subheading">Conclusion & Results</h3>
  <p class="innerpage__text">After the redesign was presented to the relevant stakeholders (engineers, product team, rest of the Operations team, and the CPO), we made a few changes but ultimately got the go ahead to build the redesign. </p>
  <p class="innerpage__text">We timed the length of time the user needed to complete a task flow with the old and new design and we found out that
    <span class="bold pinkhighlight">the time taken to complete key tasks was decreased by 20% </class></p>
